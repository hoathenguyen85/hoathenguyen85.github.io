      <h1>Race to Identity</h1>
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>

          This is an interesting video.  I think the word identity really hits me hard.  I am in fact a first generation American born Vietnamese.  Not only am I Vietnamese, my ancestor is in North Vietnam.  But make no mistake, my dad is against communism and fought against the North, so that partially explains why I was born in America. So you may wonder why I even split my nationality even further by saying North Vietnamese.  Something I learned quite recently, is the fact that I do not look Vietnamese.  Many Asians, including Vietnamese, think I look Chinese or maybe Korean when I grow my hair out.  People may think that because most of the Vietnamese in America are South Vietnamese.  Some reason South Vietnamese people have less Chinese traits.  But make things worse, I'm grew up as an American who does not even know his own language, but I love my Vietnamese food that grosses out many Americans.  I feel like I do not have a good grasp of my identity.  But there are things that help me grasp my identity at the same time with stereotype threats.

        <p>
          Stereotype threat is interesting to my identity.  I do fight back when I hear people make fun of Vietnam.  If you don't know, Vietnamese and Chinese have some racial tension towards each other.  I have nothing against Chinese people, but I was taught to hate Communism, which China is.  Was nice to know about Taiwan, because I can respect them because they fought for the same belief.  I also have some prejudice against some arrogant Chinese people.  These are the people who learn that I am Vietnamese, and likes to put me down.  Likes outright saying I'm dirty and Vietnam is not special.  So this stereotype threat experience somewhat help me have a strong identity with Vietnam.  This might be when I learn I am Vietnamese, as Claude said in the video when he learned he was black.  Caused by racism.  Interesting huh?  But funny thing is that I do hate Vietnam as well.  Vietnam being a communist country still.  Being American, I kind of do see Vietnam as being dirty.  Contradiction I am huh?  HAH!  Many Asians I feel do not understand my American mind.  And pushes me away from my Asian identity.  When I do stuff Americans would do, I can tell in the head of the Asians people thinking, "What is wrong with you?"  They have that racism against the American ways and makes me feel more American.  I am in fact a melting pot of culture in me!

          Now I am thinking I should not be looking for my identity at specific nationality.  My nationality and where I was born just help defines who I am.  Makes me unique.  But at the same time, I don't want to be unique.  I want to find other people who I can identify with.  That what helps me attract to DBC.  I can sense that I feel that to students I interact with, I can somehow relate with them.  I don't know how to explain it, but I have that sense of belonging here.  But at the same time I don't, because I am pretty programming savvy.  I feel like I am being alienated by people who are new to programming.  Sounds like the story Claude talks about when a white person who is the least racist put themselves further away from black people when want to talk about racial profiling.  People who are new to programming steps further away from me so that they won't feel dumb.  I do see some programming savvy people, and I need to learn to not be shy and work with those people.  But I also want to work with people who are new to programming to help them improve!

          Obviously I am not a minority in the programming field.  I want to work with these minority and give them good feedback!  When I work with people, I am very patient.  I want my partner to feel like they belong.  Mainly because I seek that feeling too!  I might act dumb at some point to help them feel better.  Yet at the same time I do dumb stuff because I'm quite ditzy.  So don't try hard to understand me xD!!  I am quite the enigma, yet people can read me easily!  OMG so confusing I am!  Anyways, I also want to see the good quality in people and see how to use that to help motivate them in staying in DBC and improving themselves too.  I hope I can help you find your identity better.  As I write this, now I know who I am.  I am a DBCer! We are DBCer!  Race and sex means nothing, we are in DBC together.  So let's learn together the ways of DBC and become the best software engineers!
