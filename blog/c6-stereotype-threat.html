      <h1>Feeding Off of Your Feedback</h1>
      <h2>Makes Me STRONGER!!!</h2>

          This was definitely an interesting experience for me.  I am usually a loner and work on my own.  Especially at work where I am the only programmer.  Nobody usually bothers me and I figure things out on my own.  Sometimes I feel like it is hard for me to explain what I want because it goes over everybody's head.  I thought I'd feel the same here, but when I explain some technical programming materials, I get surprised by how quick people catch on.  Plus y'all are eager to learn new stuff, so when I show new ideas or use of tools, y'all like the tip and is thankful for it.  Feels great passing new knowledge to people!  Also feels good that people like my funny side.  =)

          What frustrates me is my low self-confidence.  Apparently when reading some comments.  Two people actually caught on to that.  Y'all really surprise me when I am that easy to read.  I need to stop putting myself down.  Need to see that I have potential.  Hope I can use DBC to polish myself, and help me shine.  And there is no best place to shine than the Big Apple!  I definitely use this feedback to help improve myself, now that I know it really shows.

          I find it hard to give feedback.  I was bored and pretended I was the Hulk.  Noticed many people did not care for that humor lol.  But some people like it.  If you saw that feedback and liked it, e-mail me! ;)  I was pretty truthful in what I said, just being funny and playful.  But it is hard for me to put thought into words.  I remember when Brook told me about right and left brain...though I forgot already which brain sounded like me...it did leave an impression on me.  Doing these feedback will help me strengthen the other half of my brain to help me pick my words better!  Slowly when I learn to trust myself and talking to people, I'll learn how to talk to people more and give better feedback.  I'll also need to learn how to think about what I can do to improve people.  I am totally clueless in this section, but as I rate other people's feedback, I will get the idea.
