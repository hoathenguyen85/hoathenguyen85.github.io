      The DBC experience is very mind blowing.  The whole idea of the kitchen vs the resturaunt mentality really gets to me.  We need to stop being picky and do something about it.  Be control of ourselves and build something awesome!  I guess this was the analogy to the fixed and growth mindset.  The idea that DBC is a huge experiment makes sense.  In the technology world, things change all the time. what was in is now out.  New things are made each year!  DBC has to keep up with these changes and not be fixed to one thing.  DBC will not grow into a better machine if it stayed static and frozen in time.  I canot wait to see the team and work with y'all!

       After seeing the culture of DBC.  My expectation has gone up.  Honestly I did look at DBC as the resturaunt.  I didn't join because cost of living and the tuition.  Then when I apperently got voted to be part of the deferred tuition payment, that hooked me in financially.  I figured, sounds like a good deal, so hope it helps what I am asking for.  But seeing that DBC not only helps me as a developer, but also as a person.  That just blew my mind.  It's like my prayers have been answered.  When Shareef talked about his friend that he helped learn RoR, I totally related to him.  Although I got a degree in Computer Science, I am not a Senior System Analyst for the IT department.  Yet I feel so blah.  I really want to be a developer and this talk really energized me up!  I am looking forward to see how DBC will change my train of thought.  Can't wait to see what it is like to work with a group of people on a project.  I hope I am good enough to teach my fellow students as well to help their experience!  Only thing I am nervous about is the fact a small city country boy like me will be living in a big city.  Hope the big apple will treat me nicely!
