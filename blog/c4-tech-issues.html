      <h1>Good Company Going Away?</h1>
      <h2>What happens when company buys another</h2>

          Well I work for Brazos County IT Department.  One thing I noticed are that some big companies important are going away because they get bought by another company.  We were going to get a new Judicial software to get away from a company that steals $1 million from us with crappy service, and they are number 1 in the country for this software!  The new company we were going to go to looked promising, but it got bought by another company.  Of course what usually happens after a company buys another, is firing unneeded people!  Like what happened when Microsoft bought Nokia.  Many employees got laid off.  It is just an unfortunate side effect when a company buys another.  The next big thing that happened was that they axed all the projects!  So Brazos County lost tons of money and a company to rely on.   We then had to crawl back to a thieving company.

          Only solution I can see to help this from happening is to build a company with a good structure!  Though the new company had a better software, the organization and culture is horrid.  People bad mouth other co-worker.  People are not synced up on projects.  Documentation was a mess!  And for this very reason of messy work ethic, made the new company maybe see that the project is a wasted effort.  So why waste money that looks like a spaghetti mess, just axe it and start something new.  This is why I want to learn EQ.  I can see this helps the culture of the company.  Then I’ll have to find people who likes this type of culture.  Then I’ll have to find a way to have good work ethic in each department the company needs to run.  Hopefully with EQ, we can help integrate the departments together and work like a good team!  All helping each other for the sake of the company.  Have each department help each other to be more efficient and giving each other good feedback.  May seem like a childish dream, but I’d like to see if this is true!

          Just a shout out, but the public industry realy need more software to help them out!  I am tired and sick of these mom and pop Access database companies.  They survive and make tons of money!  WTF!!  Interested?  Come to me and ask.  Might come up with a good start-up company and get rich!
