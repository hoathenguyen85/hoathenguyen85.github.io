    <h1>What are they?</h1>
    <p>
      So you are probably looking at a website and notice there are spacing between some boxes on the website.  Did you know there are 3 ways to set these spacings in CSS? Lets see the names of these then understand how to use them.  They are called margin, border and padding!  Confused?  Well let me apply a real life example to help understand what these are.  Imagine that I actually have real boxes to represent my website.  So I have a couple of cardboard boxes with packages in them.  Now lets cut these boxes in half!  The package are the words inside the box.  You see the styrofoam protecting the packages?  Well you would say they are padding the package.  And guess what, that is caled padding in CSS.  It is the spacing between the package and the box.  Now look at the thin cardboard.  That is the border!  Now think about when I have 2 boxes near each other.  Notice the gap between the boxes?  Well in CSS we call that the margin.  I hope this helps you understand more about margin, border, and padding in CSS!
