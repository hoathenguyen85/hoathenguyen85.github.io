      <h1>Lambdas, Procs, and Blocks!</h1>
      <h2>Oh my!</h2>
      <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
          First off I would like to say why I chose to my title in reverse order.  Obviously I am copying Wizard of Oz "Lion, Tigers, and Bears.  Oh my!"  Lamda starts with an L and has 2 syllables like lion, then blocks start with a B and has one syllable.  In this blog, I will be talking them in the order of blocks, procs, and lambda. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are blocks, procs, and lambda?  They are a closure type that is used in Ruby.  It is a very strong tool you can use in Ruby.  So what is a closure?  Paul Cantrell at <a href="https://innig.net">https://innig.net</a> says it is the following:
          <ul>
            <li>It can be passed around as a value and executed on demand by anyone who has that value, at which time it can refer to variables from the context in which it was created (i.e. it is closed with respect to variable access, in the mathematical sense of the word "closed").</li>
          </ul>
          These 3 closure type are cool ways to reuse group of code logic!
        <p>
          <h5>Blocks</h5>
          <pre>
            def print_cohort(&amps;block)
              puts block.call
            end

            print_cohort { ["Andrew Dye", "Anna MacDonald", "Ayako Kurushima"] }
            > Andrew Dye
            > Anna MacDonald
            > Ayako Kurushima

            print_cohort { {1 => "Angel Baek", 2 => "Benjamin Cheng", 3 => "Christopher Thomas Pelnar"} }
            > {1=>"Angel Baek", 2=>"Benjamin Cheng", 3=>"Christopher Thomas Pelnar"}

            print_cohort { "Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg"] }
            > Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg
          </pre>
           In the example above you see that the print_cohort method somehow prints whatever is between the curly brackets.  Between the curly brackets are the block that I passed into the print cohort method.  In the method I print out whatever object I put into the block.  Notice it printed out an Array, Hash, and a String!  See how this helps reuse your code?  Cool huh?  Also notice how an &amp; is in front of the argument block.  Then to call what is in the block I used block.call.  Then I call the method, and I added a block to the end of the method that I wanted the method to print.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Procs</h5>
          <pre>
            def print_cohort(proc)
              puts proc.call
            end

            proc = Proc.new { ["Andrew Dye", "Anna MacDonald", "Ayako Kurushima"] }

            print_cohort(proc)
            > Andrew Dye
            > Anna MacDonald
            > Ayako Kurushima

            proc = Proc.new { {1 => "Angel Baek", 2 => "Benjamin Cheng", 3 => "Christopher Thomas Pelnar"} }

            print_cohort(proc)
            > {1=>"Angel Baek", 2=>"Benjamin Cheng", 3=>"Christopher Thomas Pelnar"}

            proc = Proc.new { "Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg"] }

            print_cohort(proc)
            > Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg
          </pre>
          Proc, short for procedure, as you can see is similar to block.  One difference is that I save a block of code inside a variable.  Then I can call the code by using the variable.  Also noticed how my print_cohort method no longer needs the &amps; in front of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Lambdas</h5>
          <pre>
            def print_cohort(lambda)
              puts lambda.call
            end

            l = lambda { ["Andrew Dye", "Anna MacDonald", "Ayako Kurushima"] }

            print_cohort(l)
            > Andrew Dye
            > Anna MacDonald
            > Ayako Kurushima

            l = lambda  { {1 => "Angel Baek", 2 => "Benjamin Cheng", 3 => "Christopher Thomas Pelnar"} }

            print_cohort(l)
            > {1=>"Angel Baek", 2=>"Benjamin Cheng", 3=>"Christopher Thomas Pelnar"}

            l = lambda  { "Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg"] }

            print_cohort(l)
            > Chris Lintecum, Morgan McCrory, Paul Clegg
          </pre>
          Here you see lambda is exactly the same as proc.  Hmm maybe I should show another example to show the difference between proc and lambda.
          <pre>
            def cohort
              Proc.new { return ["Andrew Dye", "Anna MacDonald", "Ayako Kurushima"] }.call
              return "Can't get here"
            end

            print cohort
            > Andrew Dye
            > Anna MacDonald
            > Ayako Kurushima

            def cohort(lambda)
              lambda.call
              return "Whoops, used method wrong.  I printed this instead"
            end

            l = lambda { return ["Andrew Dye", "Anna MacDonald", "Ayako Kurushima"] }

            print cohort(l)
            > Whoops, used method wrong.  I printed this instead
          </pre>
          As you can see when a proc has a return in it, the proc stops the method and does not let it continue to that return method.  While lambda returns it's object, but the method continued to still wrong and returned something I did not want.  The is another difference, let me show you that example:
          <pre>
            def cohort(proc)
              proc.call("Angel Baek", "Benjamin Cheng", "Christopher Thomas Pelnar")
            end

            proc = Proc.new {|a,b,c,d| "#{a}, #{b}, #{c}, #{d}"}

            print cohort(proc)
            > Angel Baek, Benjamin Cheng, Christopher Thomas Pelnar, => nil


            def cohort(lambda)
              lambda.call("Angel Baek", "Benjamin Cheng", "Christopher Thomas Pelnar")
            end

            l = lambda {|a,b,c,d| "#{a}, #{b}, #{c}, #{d}"}

            print cohort(l)
            > ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 4)
          </pre>
          You will notice that in the call method for both proc and lambda, I passed in 3 arguments, while the code requires 4 arguments.  With proc, a nil was passed to the d argument.  While with lamdba, you got an error.
