        <h1>My thinking style for DBC</h1>
        <p>
          Based on the test I have a concrete sequential mind style.  At first I kind of disagreed because I also see myself as concrete random because I am definitely an experimentor when learning and I think I rely on intuition.  People say they don't like it when I say something feels off.  And I base my idea off of that.  Maybe I do have good intuition and just cannot explain it well.  Maybe I have bad intuition.  Who knows.  Was looking at DBC to understand this!  Wow you can kind of see I am random.  But I can also see that I am concrete sequential.  I like things in order, I follow direction, and I want the facts before thinking about something.  My brain seems to be a contradiction!  I do find it hard to work in a group because I mosty been working as a lone wolf.  But I want to get over that way of thinking I am always by myself and I should stay that way.  I want to work in a team environment!  I wanna grow, I do not want to stay in a fixed mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a very quick learner, and I learn pretty well with hands-on homework to show me the idea of te lesson.  Even though I know some of these phase 0 stuff, I still read all the mateials to make sure I am not skipping any vital information.  I only skip when I feel like I have no time and need to get things done.  But this is bad, because I am bound to make mistakes!  I do not think the material of DBC is going to give me struggle, just the way I think will make me struggle the most.  I am super bad at planning my time.  I need to get myself into the habit of time-boxing, so that I can efficiently use my time.  Even though I am behind now, I feel like if I quit now and try again later, I will have the same issue.  I'll learn nothing by giving up.  I hope DBC can help change my train of thought to improve my weakness.  Or at least team up someone who knows how to manage time and can compliment with my strengths.  I really want to be in the growth mindset.  I do not want to give up so easily.  I'll face these challenges, and overcome these obstacles.  I hope DBC will make me a better person. =)
